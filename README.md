#Broker: Cash
####The ecstasy of gold

##Purpose
Broker: Cash is a LibDataBroker plugin that remembers all your characters gold balance along with daily, weekly, monthly and yearly variations.

This addon requires a LDB display such as [ChocolateBar](https://mods.curse.com/addons/wow/chocolatebar) (my favorite) or [Bazooka](https://mods.curse.com/addons/wow/bazooka) or whichever you prefer.

Currently available in English (default) and French.


##Details
Broker: Cash does not maintain a full history of your gold gains and losses; it merely keeps tracks of the *variations* of your gold balance.

* **Daily**: variation since midnight
* **Weekly**: variation since past monday at midnight
* **Monthly**: variation since the 1st of the current month at midnight
* **Yearly**: variation since January, 1st of the current year at midnight

Each stat is reset to 0 at the beginning of the corresponding period.

Also, a special, dynamic *session* statistic shows how much gold the current character earned or spent since connection.


##Configuration
There is no user configurable options. Just install and enjoy!


##TODO
There is currently no way to delete or reset a character's stats; I'll add this functionnality in a future release.
